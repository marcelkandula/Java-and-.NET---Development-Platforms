# Technology Platforms – Laboratory Exercises

This repository contains a collection of laboratory exercises completed as part of the *Technology Platforms* course. The course focuses on the development of software systems using Java and .NET technologies, covering topics such as data structures, multithreading, networking, persistence, testing, GUI development, and cross-platform migration.

## Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders, each representing a distinct laboratory sessions. The exercises include applications, implemented in Java (Maven projects) and .NET (WPF and console apps). Some labs are built upon the previous ones.

## Covered Topics

### Java Labs

* **Lab 1**: Recursive data structures, sorting using `Comparable` and `Comparator`, hierarchical statistics generation.
* **Lab 2–3**: Parallel computing and synchronization using Java threads, performance benchmarking between sequential and parallel execution.
* **Lab 4**: TCP/UDP socket communication between client and server with multithreaded server-side processing.
* **Lab 5**: Object-relational mapping using JPA (Hibernate) and in-memory H2 database, including CRUD operations and advanced queries.
* **Lab 6**: Unit testing with JUnit and Mockito, repository/controller separation and mocking.

### .NET Labs

* **Lab 7**: WPF application for displaying and editing recursive object trees using `TreeView`, context menus, and modal forms.
* **Lab 8**: LINQ queries, XML serialization/deserialization, XPath and LINQ-to-XML processing integrated into the WPF UI.
* **Lab 9**: Dynamic data binding in `DataGrid`, advanced search and sort functionality using `ObservableCollection<T>`.
* **Lab 10**: Multithreaded computation in .NET using four approaches: `Task`, delegates, `async/await`, and `BackgroundWorker`.
* **Lab 11–12**: Full-duplex TCP client-server application with serialized object communication, dynamic object manipulation, fault handling, and support for multi-client scenarios.
